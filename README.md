<h1 align="center">Hi there, I'm Khalil Zakout! 👋</h1>

<h2 align="center"> 🚀 Aspiring Data Engineer | Streaming & Batch Pipelines | Python | Kafka | GCP</h2>

I’m a data enthusiast focused on building scalable **streaming** and **batch** data pipelines, automated workflows, and cloud-based analytics systems. I design and implement end-to-end data pipelines using **`Python`**, **`SQL`**, **`Apache Kafka`**, **`Apache Airflow`**, and **`Google Cloud Platform`**, covering real-world use cases from real-time ingestion to batch analytics in **`BigQuery`**.

I also leverage **`Excel`** and **`Power BI`** for data analysis and visualization when needed, with a strong emphasis on production-style data engineering practices.
